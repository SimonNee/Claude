# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a private learning repository for experimenting with Claude Code, focusing on projects involving C++, Python, KDB+/q, and AI models from Hugging Face.

## Technology Stack

- **C++**: For performance-critical components
- **Python**: For scripting, data processing, and ML model integration
- **KDB+/q**: For time-series data and high-performance analytics
- **Hugging Face**: For AI/ML models and transformers

## Development Notes

- Large model files (*.pt, *.pth, *.safetensors) are excluded from version control via .gitignore
- Update this file with specific build commands, test procedures, and architecture patterns as the codebase develops
